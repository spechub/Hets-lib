%%       The Design Pattern Library will be ideally generated       %%
%%       automatically by some tool from design pattern             %%
%%       constructors (DPCs) defined, e.g., in SWCommonPatterns.    %%

%%       For each DPC with name n there will be a specification     %%
%%       with name DP_{n} containing one constant with the same     %%
%%       name defined by the DPC and all function parameters        %%
%%       of the DPC are replaced by newly defined constants.        %%
%%       For an example see the specification below.                %%

%%       This constantification has to be made in order to map      %%
%%       concrete specifications to these design patterns           %%
%%       by means of signature morphisms.                           %%
