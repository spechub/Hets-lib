%% signs are physical artifacts
%% Signs have a low density of symbols, i.e., the number of symbols on a sign may not exceed seven (?) items. 
%% symbols convey information or point to other objects.     
%% ( in principle: signs can be classified into different types of signs, such as road sign or warning sign. )
